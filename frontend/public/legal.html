    <li>“Agreement” means bother the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy below, together.</li>

    <h2 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h2>

    <h3 id="agreement">Agreement</h3>

    <p>This Agreement is only about this Website. It is <strong>not</strong> about the pledge language itself. Nobody is going to hold you contractually to the pledge.</p>

    <p>Your use of this Website is <strong>expressly conditioned</strong> on your agreement to these Terms of Service and the Privacy Policy below. If you do not understand either, or do not agree to be bound by both of them, you may not access or use the Website.</p>

    <h3 id="what-this-website-does">What This Website Does</h3>

    <p>This Website helps people sign the <a href="http://neveragain.tech">http://neveragain.tech</a> pledge. The volunteer organizers of the pledge verify the identity of every signer. To do this, volunteers may review signers’ social media profiles. This Website automates part of that process by allowing a signer to authenticate via Twitter. Once that is done, the Website automatically reads the signer’s Twitter profile information, and uses it to create a Pull Request in the pledge’s GitHub repository. Volunteers then review that Pull Request, and if everything checks out, merge that Pull Request to add the signature to the pledge.</p>

    <h3 id="eligibility">Eligibility</h3>

    <p>By using the Website’s pledge-signing function, you represent and warrant that you are legally qualified to enter into and form contracts under applicable law, and that you agree to this Agreement.</p>

For the avoidance of doubt, this disclaimer includes all warranties arising by operation of law or otherwise, including, without limitation, any and all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, no encumbrance, or title, in addition to any warranties arising from a course of dealing, usage, or trade practice.
